## 1. Bike Share Analysis

This project examines how casual riders and annual members use a bike‑share service differently by analyzing a full year of ride data. The findings reveal clear patterns in when and how each group rides, helping us understand their needs and habits. These insights highlight strong opportunities to convert casual riders into annual members through targeted offers. With this evidence, we can build a focused marketing strategy that increases membership and supports long‑term growth.

## 2. Job Advertisement Analysis

This project shows how automated web scraping can turn unstructured website content into a clean dataset for analyzing job market trends. After collecting and preparing the data, the analysis focuses on identifying which factors - such as job type, location, or company - are linked to higher salaries. The workflow combines automation, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis to reveal clear patterns in hiring and compensation. The result is a scalable solution that replaces manual data collection and provides companies with fast, reliable insights for smarter decision‑making.

## 3. Hypothesis Tests on Students Scores and Self-Study Hours

This project delivers a full end‑to‑end statistical analysis showing how weekly self‑study hours relate to academic performance. Using clean, university‑collected data, we confirmed a significant positive relationship and demonstrated the use of advanced statistical tools - including correlation analysis, t‑tests, and proportion tests. The result is a clear, classroom‑ready case study that connects real student behavior with rigorous statistical reasoning.

## 4. Online Ratail Transactions Analysis

This project analyzes real sales data from an online retail store to uncover the patterns that drive its performance. By examining top‑revenue countries, best‑selling products, and peak sales periods, the analysis highlights where the business earns the most - and where opportunities are being missed. Clear trends emerge: the UK dominates revenue, a handful of products generate disproportionate sales, Thursdays outperform all other days, and November shows a major seasonal surge. These insights translate directly into actionable strategies, from targeted promotions to improved inventory planning, helping the store make smarter, data‑driven decisions in a competitive retail environment.

## 5. Storage Facility Management

This project delivers a focused, end‑to‑end analysis of Mint Classics’ inventory and sales data to support a key operational decision: identifying which warehouse should be closed. Using SQL to explore stock distribution, capacity utilization, customer value, and product‑line performance, the analysis revealed that Warehouse D holds the smallest share of total inventory while operating at high capacity - making it the least impactful location to retire. Alongside this core finding, the project also uncovers broader insights into customer behavior and product trends, offering a data‑driven foundation for strategic planning across the business.

## 6. Flightradar24 API Webscraping

This project is a technology-driven analysis of real-world flight traffic over Budapest, built on historical data collected from Flightradar24. It demonstrates a complete geospatial data pipeline, covering data ingestion, airspace boundary identification, spatial filtering, and interactive visualization. Through time-based analytics, the project uncovers clear hourly and weekly traffic patterns, highlighting how aircraft movement evolves across different periods. Overall, it shows how raw aviation tracking data can be transformed into meaningful, decision-ready airspace insights, serving as a scalable foundation for applications in traffic monitoring, urban planning, and aviation analytics.

## 7. Streaming Service Churn Prediction

This project presents a complete, real-world churn prediction solution built with machine learning. It walks through the entire data science pipeline, from exploratory analysis and feature engineering to model training, validation, and interpretation. By identifying the key factors that drive customer churn and accurately predicting at-risk customers, the project demonstrates how predictive analytics can support proactive retention strategies. Ultimately, it bridges the gap between technical modeling and business value, showing how data-driven insights can directly improve customer lifetime value and reduce revenue loss.

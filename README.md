## 1. Bike Share Analysis

This project examines how casual riders and annual members use a bike‑share service differently by analyzing a full year of ride data. The findings reveal clear patterns in when and how each group rides, helping us understand their needs and habits. These insights highlight strong opportunities to convert casual riders into annual members through targeted offers. With this evidence, we can build a focused marketing strategy that increases membership and supports long‑term growth.

## 2. Job Advertisement Analysis

This project shows how automated web scraping can turn unstructured website content into a clean dataset for analyzing job market trends. After collecting and preparing the data, the analysis focuses on identifying which factors - such as job type, location, or company - are linked to higher salaries. The workflow combines automation, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis to reveal clear patterns in hiring and compensation. The result is a scalable solution that replaces manual data collection and provides companies with fast, reliable insights for smarter decision‑making.
